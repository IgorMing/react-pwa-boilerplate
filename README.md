# React PWA Boilerplate

A boilerplate project created from the Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) boilerplate generator. Besides the regular files that are generated normally, we have on this one, some specific extra configuration, that would be considered essential for a good, fluent and pragmatic development when you start something.

You can follow up here a basic flow with Login and Home page, with a consistent authentication flow already configured.

We can find here some libraries, check the most important ones below:

* Redux
* React Router
* Eslint (with Airbnb's pattern already configured)

So, just enjoy it!
